Better Mediumcore
Make softcore deaths a lot harsher â€” and more exciting!

Better Mediumcore is a lightweight Terraria mod that extends death penalties in Terraria. Instead of just dropping coins, you can now lose random items from your armor, trinkets, hotbar, and inventory on death. You can also strip modifiers from your equipment to make death sting even more.

Features:

Configurable chances and counts for:

Armor deletion

Trinket deletion

Hotbar item deletion

Inventory item deletion

Option to drop items or have them vanish permanently

Optional removal of item modifiers (prefixes) on death

Post-death message showing what you lost

Full control over settings via server-side config

Designed to make Terraria deaths feel more meaningful without forcing you into true mediumcore.
Perfect for players who want higher stakes but still prefer playing softcore.

KNOWN ISSUE: Armor appearance does not refresh after death but will refresh upon reload. Currently working on this.
